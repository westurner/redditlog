should could just
replicate from URIs to filesystem
as a fuse filesystem
or as batch synchronization

because comments are branches,
there's a folder for the branch,
and a file for the node


/123/comment.md
/123/876/comment.md

sort of like pairtree.

maybe with VCS commmit hooks

unionfs of local cache + remote FUSE

slow batching vs page parsing

assert predicate( obj.author in AUTHORS )
